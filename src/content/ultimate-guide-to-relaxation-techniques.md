## Why is deep breathing effective?

Deep breathing exercises help lower blood pressure and reduce stress hormones. A popular method is the 4-7-8 technique, where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This method calms the nervous system and promotes a relaxed state.

## What is progressive muscle relaxation?

Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group, starting from the toes and moving up to the head. This method releases physical tension and brings awareness to areas of the body that may be holding stress.
